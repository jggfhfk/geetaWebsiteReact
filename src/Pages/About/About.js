                            The Bhagavad Gita is a 700-verse
                            Hindu scripture that is part of
                            the Indian epic Mahabharata. It is
                            a conversation between prince Arjuna
                            and the god Krishna, who serves as
                            his charioteer. In this conversation,
                            Krishna provides Arjuna with guidance
                            on how to deal with moral dilemmas and
                            make decisions that are in line with
                            Dharma (duty/righteousness). The Bhagavad
                            Gita is highly respected for its spiritual
                            guidance and has been commented upon by
                            various philosophers and scholars. Itâ€™s
                            not just a religious book, but also a
                            scripture that has philosophical and practical
                            insights which are relevant even today.
